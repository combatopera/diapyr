YM2149 emulator in Python, NumPy and a little Cython where it matters. The aims of this project are to demonstrate it can be done in Python (done), accurate emulation (now probably the most accurate implementation out there), and interoperability with existing tools (MIDI support). Unlike other projects, we don't emulate the rest of the Atari ST.
